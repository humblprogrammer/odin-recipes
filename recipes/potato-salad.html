    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There is nothing like a bowl of good old-fashioned southern Potato Salad. <br>
       A go to potato salad recipe is something everyone needs to have on hand. <br>
       Everyone has their own way of making Southern-Style Potato Salad, but they are usually very creamy, heavy on the mayo, with a little mustard. <br>
       They also typically contain hard-boiled egg, pickle relish (typically sweet), and paprika sprinkled on top.</p>
